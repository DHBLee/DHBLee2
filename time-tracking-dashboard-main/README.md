## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS

### What I learned

I learned how to use a json file and effectively use it for my JS. There was also a json file in a project I did and I didn't use it, so comparing it now, my lines of codes is now shorter and easier to understand!


### Continued development

But still, I believe there are still more efficient and scalable codes for this project so I'll still continue to study and learn HTML, CSS, and JS.



### Useful resources
