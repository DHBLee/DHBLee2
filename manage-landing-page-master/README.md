## My process


### Built with


- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS




### What I learned

My first team implementing SCSS on my fronend mentor challenge. I learned how to use SCSS hoping that my CSS will be more organized and efficient. So far, SCSS helped me to organize my code, and to use efficient and convenient styling by using the BEM and nesting features. 


### Continued development

I still haven't learned all the features that SCSS can offer, so I'll continue learning that one. As well as learning more JS/HTML codes and how to make it efficient and scalable.
