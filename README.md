# Automating GWA Calculations
### Video Demo: <https://youtu.be/hucsQT-Pj8c>
### Description: So I made a python script that calculates the GWA (General Weighted Average) of students, with additional features such as knowing your scores and removing your data from the csv file. This script allows the student to predict what certificate they will get based on their GWA. Three classifications are Pink, Purple, Green, which corresponds to bronze, silver, and gold respectively. For this automation, it is heavily reliant in conditional arguments and loops, just because the script is asking for the user's input, and we all know that we should not trust what the user inputs, so the script is heavily reliant in conditional and loops arguments. The script also used some necessary modules: time for delays, csv for handling files, sys for system functions, and inflect for converting numbers to words and making lists sound nice in English. It sets up some global dictionaries: students for storing names and GWAs, subjects for linking subjects to their credit units, and letter_equivalent for mapping letter grades to numbers that help calculate the GWA.The Get_GWA class is basically the heart of the script, doing all the heavy lifting for calculating a student's GWA. It starts off by taking in a student's name, a sum for storing cumulative grades, and an empty list for grades. If you don't give it a name, it throws a ValueError. The produce_products method asks the user for their letter grades for each subject and checks the input to make sure the grades are valid. Then it uses those grades with the subject credit units to calculate the total weighted sum. The GWA method works out the final GWA by dividing the weighted sum by the total units and rounding it to two decimal places. The input_file method saves the student's name and GWA into a CSV file, adding the data while also writing headers if the file is new. The print method shows a delayed output of the GWA and hands out certificates based on GWA ranges, with different colors to represent how well the student did. The remove_file function lets you delete a student's data from the CSV by filtering out the name you specify and then writing the rest back to the file. The know_top1 function finds the student(s) with the highest GWA by reading through the CSV, comparing GWA values, and announcing the top student(s), even handling ties. The main function is where everything starts. It asks the user if they want to know their GWA, remove their data, or see who the top student is, and then takes them to the right function based on their choice.
