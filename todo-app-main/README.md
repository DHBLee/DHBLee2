## My process

I first started planning my html so that I can easily apply css and make bunch of things cohesive as much as possilble. Then I added the JS after implmeenting CSS and HTML. I had to swith up some CSS to cope up with the JS code I made but things worked out in the end/

### Built with


- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS




### What I learned

I learned a lot of JS code here. HTML and CSS was fine and is not hard,  but JS is hard as heck! I learned more on forEach loop, addevent listener, and some new syntaxes. 


### Continued development

Definetely making my code more effcient and scalable. My codes right now are for the sake of making things work.
